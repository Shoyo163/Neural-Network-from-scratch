# Neural-Network-from-scratch
This repository contains a complete implementation of a Neural Network built from scratch using Numpy. The code includes detailed explanations of Forward Propagation, Backward Propagation, and the mathematical concepts involved. The Neural Network is designed for a binary classification problem and is tested on a real dataset.
